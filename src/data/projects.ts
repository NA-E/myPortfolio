    overview: 'Leadflow is a SaaS application that analyzes newsletter engagement data to automatically score and rank leads. Instead of manually tracking who opened what, the system watches reader behavior and surfaces the people most likely to convert.',
    challenge: 'Newsletter creators and coaches were sitting on a goldmine of engagement data but had no way to use it. They\'d send emails to thousands of subscribers with no idea who was actually interested in buying. Sales conversations started cold, and high-intent readers slipped through the cracks.',
    solution: 'Built a full SaaS platform that connects to existing email tools, tracks engagement signals like clicks, opens, and reply patterns, and produces a ranked lead list updated in real time. The highest-intent subscribers bubble to the top so the sales team knows exactly who to reach out to and when.',
